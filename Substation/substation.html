    <h1 align="center">Substation disconnect switch information</h1>
    <p align="center">In electrical engineering, a disconnector, disconnect switch or isolator switch is used to ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for<p>
    <p align="center">service or maintenance. They are only used for breaking the circuit and are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where<p>
    <p align="center">machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. Disconnectors can be manual or motor operated and may be paired<p>
    <p align="center">with an earthing switch to ground the portion that has been isolated from the system for ensuring the safety of equipment and the personnel working on it.<p>
    
    <p align="center">High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission<p>
    <p align="center">lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Unlike load switches and<p>
    <p align="center">circuit breakers, disconnectors lack a mechanism for suppression of electric arcs, which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically<p>
    <p align="center">interrupted. Thus, they are off-load devices, with very low breaking capacity, intended to be opened only after the current has been interrupted by some<p>
    <p align="center">other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some<p>
    <p align="center">countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked).<p>
